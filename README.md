## Description
The ultimate goal of this project is to analyze crimes that occur at Seattle, places and time that crimes occur mostly and some of the factors that may have contributed to the occurrences of crimes. Business goal: To find the safest neighborhoods to put an infrastructure where there would be minimal crimes. Failure to properly translate the business problem into a Data Mining problem leads to one of the dangers we are trying to avoid - learning things that are true, but not useful.
